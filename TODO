1. Work out approach to support default arguments in APIs (wrapper class for AnyDoAPI ?):
    Example: api.tasks() should assume responseType=flat, includeDeleted=false and includeDone=false.
    At present it is necessary to provide all the arguments by API user.
    This should be changed since Any.Do interface is not mature.
