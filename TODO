1. Work out approach to support default arguments in APIs:
    e.g. api.tasks() should work with responseType=flat, includeDeleted=false and includeDone=false
    at present it is necessary to provide all the arguments

2. Any.Do mixes tasks and notes into single GET response. Should we separate tasks from notes ?

3. Simplify bind_method

4. Write more tests

5. Support Facebook login
